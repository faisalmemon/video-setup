# video-setup
A description of my video setup for podcasting and online training videos.

## Background

I don't really know much about Audio and Video recording beyond the basics you'd need to know when for example filing a bug.
I am getting into Podcasting and Online Training videos.  Whilst on that journey, I am documenting my setup because I've
noticed that there is a lot of basic knowledge that is assumed in the manuals and forums which I don't have.  I also want
to be in a position to be able to switch computer and re-install the Operating System without losing too much configuration
nuances of my old setup.

My computer is an iMac with a mid-range specification suitable for software development (16GB RAM, 1TB Storage, 5K screen).

This guide is a companion guide to my [Audio Setup Guide](https://github.com/faisalmemon/audio-setup)

## Approach

I started off experimenting using my iMac iSight camera and natural light.  The shadows were too strong and there was a yellow hue in the overall image.  The background was being captured also because the iMac camera is wide angle.

From udemy videos and youtube I found that the Logitech Webcam was highlighly regarded.  I tried to use a cloth background with it but because I was recording in HD, I could see it was a creased piece of white cloth.  So I abandoned that approach and instead use my white wall.  It has imperfections but it comes across ok.  To get clean (white-ish) lighting I used two softbox lights.  To make in-video camera picture-in-picture work properly I updated my Keynote slides.  By viewing the master slide I was able to place a blue square where the video would go.  Then I setup ScreenFlick to position the video feed on top of this blue square.  This allows me to avoid having text underlapping the video.

From experimentation I found that the final uploaded video would have a black watermark from Udemy in the bottom right, so I had to move the video insert upwards a bit.  I am still experimenting with the best arrangement but it proves advice I saw on youtube - that you should get the content done, and uploaded, and then see what is needed, rather than trying to plan for each detail in advance.

To get the webcam configured correctly, it turns out the the software for Mac from Logitech does not allow you to tune its configuration.  It comes with some ScreenCast style software instead.  I instead use ScreenFlick so did not need that.  But the Logitech software has no advanced configuration controls.  I need to zoom and pan, and remove autofocus to get a good shot without using up stray items in my background.  To do it I used some pay-for Mac App Store software called "Webcam Settings"

## Resources

I used the following equipment:

1.  [Neewer Softbox Lights (one pair)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01C54HM0O/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
1.  [Logitech C920s Webcam](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07MM4V7NR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
1.  [Webcam Settings Mac App](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/webcam-settings/id533696630?mt=12)

## Lighting Configuration

The setup I ended up with with to place both softbox lights on my desk, mostly vertical facing, either side of the iMac.  I placed the WebCam near the top centre of my iMac screen.  I don't use any other lights as my room is small and white-painted and so the light reflects around nicely.

## Teleprompter, or not

I looked into teleprompter software.  I didn't feel like getting one on a subscription-basis.  I noticed if I read notes, my diction is much better but the video picks up I am not looking at the screen.  One solution that worked well was to blu-tack a piece of the script over the iMac screen and read that.  I don't feel this is the appropriate way to go.

In the end, I've decided to write a script.  Then read the script aloud a fair bit to understand the message.  Then read
or rather paraphrase my slides and the past practice of reading the script kind of flows into my speech.  So it is semi ad-libbed.  I am still working on things but I feel this is a fruitful direction to go in.
